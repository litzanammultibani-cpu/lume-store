## 1. Micro-entreprise registration (URSSAF)

The micro-entreprise (auto-entrepreneur) regime is the simplest legal wrapper for two founders selling physical goods.

### Steps

1. **Go to the Guichet Unique:** https://procedures.inpi.fr/ — the single gateway replacing all old forms since 2023.
2. Create an account for **each** founder (LÉTHÉ as a joint venture is tricky — see below).
3. Fill out the **déclaration de début d'activité** under "Activité commerciale" → "Vente de biens".
4. Auto-forwarded to:
   - **INSEE** → issues your **SIREN** (9 digits) and **SIRET** (14 digits) within ~15 days.
   - **URSSAF** → sends your affiliation notice within 4–10 weeks.
5. Once SIRET arrives, create an account at https://www.autoentrepreneur.urssaf.fr/ to declare turnover and pay social contributions.

### Two founders — structural choice

Micro-entreprise is **single-person only**. Options:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Each founder registers their own ME, splits profit informally | Simplest, free | No shared ownership, can't bill each other cleanly |
| One founder registers ME, other becomes employed helper | Clear ownership | Employment cost (URSSAF), slower to set up |
| **Create an SAS (société)** ★ recommended for 2-founder brands | Shared ownership, clean governance, enterprise credibility | ~€300 setup cost, bookkeeping more formal |
| SASU (single-person SAS), other founder as employee | Clean, can evolve to SAS | Slightly more paperwork than ME |

**Recommendation for LÉTHÉ:** Register as **ME under Litan's name first** to validate demand (€0 cost, works this week). **Once monthly revenue > €2,000**, create an SAS jointly. Meantime, a written founder agreement (even a Notion page) covers profit split and IP ownership.

Social contributions for ME selling goods: **12.3% of turnover** (2026 rate). No turnover = no contribution. Declarations are monthly or quarterly.

### From 1 September 2026

Micro-entrepreneurs must be able to **receive electronic invoices** via an approved dematerialization platform (PDP or PPF). You don't need to **send** e-invoices yet. Choose from approved providers like Tiime, Indy, or Sage.

---

## 2. TVA (VAT)

### Franchise en base de TVA — your starting regime

While turnover is under the thresholds, you're **exempt from charging or declaring TVA**. You don't register as a TVA-payer. The Senate confirmed in late 2025 that thresholds remain:

| Activity | Threshold (N-1) | Ceiling (N) |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Sales of goods** (your case) | €85,000 | €93,500 |
| Services | €37,500 | €41,250 |

Crossing the ceiling **mid-year** makes TVA apply immediately from the 1st day of the month of crossing — not next year.

### On every invoice

Legally required while under the threshold:

> **TVA non applicable, art. 293 B du CGI**

You charge the listed price, no TVA added. You also **cannot deduct TVA on business purchases** (the trade-off).

### If you cross the threshold

- Apply for a **numéro de TVA intracommunautaire** (via service des impôts).
- Add 20% TVA to goods sold in France.
- Charge variable TVA on B2C sales to other EU countries (depends on each country's rate) **unless you use the OSS (One-Stop-Shop)** regime.
- File TVA declarations (CA3) monthly or quarterly.

### Exports

- **Outside EU (e.g. US, UK, Swiss):** VAT-free, mark invoice "Exonération TVA, art. 262 I du CGI". Customer pays import VAT at destination.
- **B2C inside EU under €10,000/yr total cross-border sales:** French TVA rate applies (once you're TVA-registered).
- **B2C inside EU over €10,000/yr:** register for **OSS-IOSS** to declare each country's VAT in one French filing.

## 5. Privacy Policy (RGPD / GDPR)

Required the moment you collect any personal data (contact form, newsletter, account, analytics, payment).

### Must disclose

- **What data** you collect (name, email, IP, order history, cookies).
- **Why** (legal basis: contract, consent, legitimate interest).
- **Retention period** (e.g. orders 10 yrs for accounting, newsletter until unsubscribe).
- **Recipients** (Stripe, Brevo, Sendcloud…).
- **Transfers outside EU** (if any — e.g. Google Analytics to US).
- **User rights:** access, rectification, erasure, opposition, portability, restriction.
- **How to exercise rights** — contact email + reference to CNIL.
- **Cookie policy** — list of cookies, purpose, duration, opt-out method.

Template: https://www.cnil.fr/fr/rgpd-par-ou-commencer (free) or Shopify auto-generated.

## 6. Cookie banner (CNIL rules)

Since 2020, CNIL requires:

- **No cookies before consent** except strictly necessary (session, cart).
- A banner with **both** "Accept all" AND "Reject all" at the same level, same size, same color weight.
- An accessible "cookie preferences" link to change choice later.
- Refusal must be as easy as acceptance (no dark patterns).
- Consent logged with timestamp.
- Applies to analytics cookies too (Google Analytics, Hotjar, Meta Pixel).

**Easy implementation:**
- Shopify: GDPR Cookie Bar app (free tier available)
- WordPress: CookieYes / Complianz
- Static site: Klaro! (open source, free) https://heyklaro.com/
- Plausible Analytics: **no banner required** (no personal data collected)

CNIL fines in 2026 reach **€375,000** for non-compliant sites.

---

## 7. Right of withdrawal (14 days)

Any B2C distance sale grants the consumer a **14-day withdrawal period**, no reason required, starting from delivery.

### Must provide

- Clear info on the right **before** sale (CGV + order page).
- A **withdrawal form** (type form at [Annexe L221-1 CC](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/)).
- Clear address for returns.
- Refund within **14 days** of notification (you can hold until you receive the returned goods).

### Critical 2026 update

**Ordinance n°2026-2 of 5 January 2026, applicable 19 June 2026**: you must provide a **dedicated feature in the customer journey** (not just info in CGV) to exercise the withdrawal right. One-click button from the customer's account, essentially.

Shopify is rolling out a module for this mid-2026; WooCommerce has community plugins.

### Exceptions (where withdrawal doesn't apply)

- Custom-made / personalized items — engraving makes a bracelet non-returnable. **State this clearly before purchase**.
- Sealed hygiene items — N/A for jewelry.

---

## 8. Business bank account

- Legally mandatory for ME only if turnover exceeds **€10,000/year for 2 consecutive years** (Code monétaire et financier art. L123-24).
- Practically needed from day 1 for Stripe, URSSAF automatic débit, and clean bookkeeping.
- See BUSINESS_APPS.md §2 for provider comparison.

---

## 9. Mediator for consumer disputes

Required since 2016 (Loi n°2015-1541). You must:

- Subscribe to a **médiateur de la consommation** (approved mediator).
- Publish their contact on your site and in CGV.

Options for ecommerce:
- **FEVAD / Médiateur du e-commerce**: https://www.mediateurfevad.fr/ (€200–500/year)
- **CM2C**: https://www.cm2c.net/ (~€150/year first year, then per case)
- **CNPM**: https://www.cnpm-mediation-consommation.eu/

Pick one, subscribe, add their info to CGV. Without one, consumer claims can escalate directly to courts.

---

## 10. Product safety & labeling (Jewelry-specific)

### REACH / Nickel Directive

All jewelry sold in the EU is subject to **REACH Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 Annex XVII, item 27**, which limits nickel release:

- **0.2 μg/cm²/week** for anything inserted in pierced skin (posts, earrings).
- **0.5 μg/cm²/week** for items in prolonged skin contact (bracelets, rings).

Testing standard: **EN 1811:2023**. Your supplier must provide a **REACH conformity declaration**. Ask Yilun explicitly — any reputable 925-silver supplier will have this on file.

### Lead and cadmium

REACH also caps lead (<0.05%) and cadmium (<0.01%) in jewelry metal.

### Hallmarking

France requires all jewelry sold with a precious-metal claim (silver ≥925, gold ≥375) to be **poinçonnée** (hallmarked). This is handled by the **Bureau de la Garantie** (via Douanes/DGDDI):

- Weight ≤30g: hallmarking voluntary for sale below a threshold, but **declaration at import** is mandatory.
- Importing from China (Alibaba suppliers): declare with DEB/EMEBI form at customs, request a **convention de garantie** with DGDDI for simplified hallmarking.
- For pieces <30g, many French brands use a **poinçon de maître** (own mark registered with DGDDI) + the 925 fineness stamp. Registration: ~€280 one-time.

Reference: https://www.douane.gouv.fr/ for the exact procedure. This is the one area where retaining a specialist (expert-comptable or customs broker) at €100–200 one-time is money well spent.

### CE marking

Jewelry **does not require CE marking** unless it contains electronic components (smart jewelry) or is a medical device.

### Labels on packaging

- Origin: "Made in China" (or wherever). Don't hide it.
- Material: "925 sterling silver" / "Argent massif 925/1000".
- Language: **French** must be present (Loi Toubon). Bilingual FR/EN is fine.

## 12. Minimum viable legal pack (what to ship)

Create these pages **before** accepting the first real payment:
